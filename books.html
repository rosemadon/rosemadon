                <h4>Blood From A Stone</h4>
                <span class="blurb"><p>Lark was framed for a crime she did not commit.</p><p>On the run and out of money, she answers an online advertisement to sell her blood to a strange older woman called Thea Sokolova. Everyone knows there’s no such thing as vampires, but nonetheless Thea drinks her blood and offers her an extra incentive: double the payment if they have sex.</p><p>But as what started as blood for pay slowly transforms into something unexpectedly tender, Lark’s past is catching up to her… and it turns out Thea may be much, much stranger than she ever realised.</p><p>BLOOD FROM A STONE is a lesbian romance novella. It’s weird and heartwarming and a little funny and quite explicitly sexual at times. All sexual content is consensual and is intended for 18+ audiences.</p></span>

                <h4>Human Fetish</h4>
                <span class="blurb"><p>Sadie woke up in a strange place and it’s only getting stranger.</p><p>Her captor is a woman with a lot of unusual questions and no idea how to make reassuring small talk. Sadie is told she’s been captured in order to participate in a medical experiment. Well, fuck that. But when Sadie injures her in an attempt to escape her prison, the woman takes her face off, and then things start to get really weird. Because aliens are here — here on Earth, here taking their fake human skin off in front of her — and this one likes Sadie a little too much.</p><p>HUMAN FETISH is a f/f erotic romance spin on the classic alien abduction and medical experiment narrative. If you like your aliens to be much more than just human and your romances explicit and a little funny, this is the story for you.</p></span>
